    <h1 class="main_heading" id="hope_heading"> The Issue </h1>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p class="info_text">
        Fire Safety is an issue which pertains to people around the world, especially those who live in California. Given that California is a chaparral biome, fires are not a rare occurrence. Yet, over the past several years, this issue has become increasingly more pervasive as both the intensity and frequency have increased, costing thousands of families their homes, possessions, and lives. These destructive “forces of nature” often stem from poor forest management, and as global climate change makes our communities increasingly inhospitable—resulting in more forest debris and loose kindling—the need for immediate reform becomes readily apparent.
      </p>
      <p class="info_text">
        In 2018, California experienced one of its worst wildfire seasons to date. Nearly 9,000 fires burned throughout the state during the year, burning through an area of almost two million acres of land (over twice the size of Rhode Island). Both of those staggering numbers, published by Cal Fire, represent all-time highs for the recorded history of the state. Additionally, the fires cost the state more than $3.5 Billion in damages.
      </p>
      <p class="info_text">
        The detrimental effects of these fires extended beyond simply geographical destruction and extreme economic impacts. Lives were lost. Throughout the course of the 2018 fire season, 104 people died, including 6 firefighters due to the flames. Additionally, the effects from smoke inhalation and particulates spewn up in the air from the fires impacted civilians throughout the state—not just those in direct proximity to the fire. In our hometown of Berkeley, dangerous particulates in the air descended into our local atmosphere, drifting from fires which raged over 100 miles away. School became increasingly difficult for our students, with many local districts closing their doors in an effort to protect students. In Berkeley, where the air quality index reached Hazardous levels, many citizens—including students—experienced severe headaches and were forced to wear N-95 masks to help prevent the harmful effects from the smoke and pollutants.

    <div class="text-box">
      <p class="info_text">
        The CARR Act (Combustion Avoidance along Rural Roads) is a bill first introduced on January 4, 2019 by California Representative Doug LaMalfa to help prevent wildfires by orchestrating fuel reduction, prescribed burning, and vegetation management. The latest action on it was when the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry (February 7, 2019). 	
      </p>

      <p class="info_text"> 
        We need your help to pass the CARR Act which could help lower the damage and frequency which these fires occur. This act will prove extremely important in mitigating the damage done throughout the nation, especially in our home state of California.
